# solitaire
`solitaire` is a simple implementation of solitaire (klondike) for the command line. I made it as a pet project to keep myself sane while working on other projects. Let me know if you like it, or post an issue if you found a bug! 

This project uses the console graphics library [illwill](https://github.com/johnnovak/illwill/), which I have included in the project.

# usage
You can select a binary from releases, or build from source. To build, make sure you have [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) installed. After, simply run `make` in the project directory, or `make run` to compile and run directly.
